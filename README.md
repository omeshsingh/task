# Task 1: Multi-Asset Portfolio Analysis

## Description

This repository contains the solution for the Multi-Asset Portfolio Analysis assessment. The Jupyter Notebook (`portfolio_analysis.ipynb`) downloads historical price data for a diversified set of assets using the `yfinance` library, cleans the data, calculates portfolio performance metrics (cumulative return, annualized return/volatility, Sharpe ratio, drawdown), performs risk analysis (correlation matrix, rolling correlation/volatility), generates visualizations, and includes an optional mean-variance optimization, fulfilling all requirements outlined in the task description.

## Files Included

*   **`portfolio_analysis.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all Python code, analysis steps, inline outputs, and explanatory Markdown cells documenting the process and findings. *(Replace `portfolio_analysis.ipynb` if your filename is different)*
*   **`portfolio_analysis_report.html`**: An HTML export of the completed notebook, including all code, text, and generated outputs (plots, tables) for easy viewing in a web browser. *(Replace `portfolio_analysis_report.html` if your filename is different)*
*   **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the repository content.

## Dependencies / How to Run

The primary notebook requires Python 3 and the following core libraries:
*   `yfinance`
*   `pandas`
*   `numpy`
*   `matplotlib`
*   `seaborn`
*   `scipy` (for the optional optimization section)

These libraries can typically be installed via pip within your Python environment:
```bash
pip install yfinance pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy
